#	HTTPS Configuration for the application

-	HTTP is a communication protocol that's used to transfer the data b/w applications
-	HTTP is not secured
-	HTTPS is a secured version of HTTP which provides confidentiality and integrity for the data transferred b/w systems
-	HTTPS uses SSL and TLS Protocols to provides secured communication b/w systems
-	SSL and TLS provides 3 layers of protection to data
	-	Encryption or Confidentiality
	-	Integrity
	-	Authentication
-	SSL and TLS uses certificates to provides the secured communication 
-	SSL and TLS uses certificates to encrypt the data that transferred b/w systems

## WS Security Standards

-	Authentication
-	Confidentiality or Encryption
-	Integrity
-	Non Repuduation


##	Steps to Implement Confidentiality or Encryption using Certificates

-	Generate keystore pairs with private key and public key with java Keytool
-	Export public key into certificate files
-	Share public key with clients
-	Import shared public key certificates into alternate keystores
-	-trustcacerts is a flag that specifies that certificates chain can be trusted
